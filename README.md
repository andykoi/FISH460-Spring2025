# Project Synopsis
The threat of microplastics in the bodies of humans and marine life are one of the most topical environmental concerns.  Among other stressors, invasive species such as European green crabs _(Carcinus maenas)_ are another threat to our coastal ecosystems. Whether European green crabs will outcompete native shore crabs within the Sound or how quickly has yet to be seen, but a variety of physiological factors may help us predict how our competing native populations will respond. Puget Sound, like most of our worldâ€™s ocean environments, contain free-floating microplastics at relatively consistent densities. Different species and phylogenetic groups of crabs have been studied to assess their physiological responses to microplastics with relatively similar results: chronic exposures cause declines in health, including PNW shore crabs. However, no studies have been conducted on crabs within the Sound nor are there available metrics that can be directly compared to European green crab responses to microplastic contamination. This project will investigate how the ingestion of microplastics is impacting native shore crabs, _H. oregonensis_, on a physiological scale to better understand the threats of plastic pollution and potential comparisons to invasive species physiology in shore crabs from within the Puget Sound.
